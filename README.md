# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone

## Self Assesment

My journey throughout my Computer Science program has been challenging but rewarding at the same time. I applied to Southern New Hampshireâ€™s computer science degree program with a concentration in software engineering with little to no prior experience with coding besides from small things on scratch. My goal when starting the program was to learn and take in as much knowledge so in the end, I would be able to launch into a career in computer science. I believe I was able to achieve my goal as I have learned and understand the development lifecycle, data structures, algorithms, databases, and the importance of security. Throughout the course I have learned a few coding languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, and python.

## Computer Science Program

In CS-250 I have learned about the development lifecycle of software engineering and how important it is to work in a team to move forward in projects. CS-260 taught me how data structures and algorithms worked and how to use them. Throughout my time in the program the idea and concept of secure coding and keeping a secure mindset was an important topic that was taught, keeping security in mind while coding and developing a program is important in not only keeping the company safe but also the potential users. The CS-340 Client/Server Development course gave me understanding of databases and security than what I already had. This course, specifically, introduced me to working with databases in MongoDB and securing them so only specific users with credentials and authentication tokens were able to access and modify the databases.

## Artifact

This portfolio will showcase my improvements in my skills and mindset as I have improved my previous courses project. This portfolio contains only one project from my mobile architecture development class but can showcase my skills in the categories of databases, software design and engineering, and data structures and algorithms. Given this capstone course I was able to choose three separate projects to improve on, but I have decided to improve one single project to its fullest while incorporating all three categories of improvements. The project I have improved upon is my event tracking app. The project is creating an app through android studio and with the project being a complete app I believed it was best to improve my project to the fullest to showcase my skillset and my growth through the computer science program.
