# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone

## Self Assesment

My journey throughout my Computer Science program has been challenging but rewarding at the same time. I applied to Southern New Hampshireâ€™s computer science degree program with a concentration in software engineering with little to no prior experience with coding besides from small things on scratch. My goal when starting the program was to learn and take in as much knowledge so in the end, I would be able to launch into a career in computer science. I believe I was able to achieve my goal as I have learned and understand the development lifecycle, data structures, algorithms, databases, and the importance of security. Throughout the course I have learned a few coding languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, and python.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3006bca8-8f60-4b94-aa6b-27188ba6c0d4)
